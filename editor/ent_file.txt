[nestled transform (component record)]

[entity record end]

Nestled entity records (if any) will show up amidst the nestled transform records. In this case
the file will look like this:

[entity record start]
.
.
.
[nestled transform (component record)]
[nestled transform (component record)]
	[entity record start]
	.
	.
	.
	[entity record end]
[nestled transform (component record)]
.
.
.
[entity record end]


this can happen an arbitrary number of times.

[entity record start]
.
.
.
[nestled transform (component record)]
	[entity record start]
	.
	.
	.
	[nestled transform (component record)]
	[nestled transform (component record)]

		[nestled transform (component record)]
			[entity record start]
			.
			.
			.
			[entity record end]
		[entity record end]
	[nestled transform (component record)]
		[entity record start]
		.
		.
		.
		[entity record end]
	[entity record end]
[entity record end]


If a component references a transform component (or more), the referenced transform(s) will be serialized right after this component. This means that the order in which the transforms were in the child list of their parent transform is not preserved.
